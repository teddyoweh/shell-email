When called with no option and no argument, tmpmail lists the messages in
the inbox and their numeric IDs.  When called with one argument, tmpmail
shows the email message with specified ID.

-b, --browser BROWSER
        Specify BROWSER (default: w3m) that is used to render the HTML of
        the email
-g, --generate [ADDRESS]
        Generate a new email address, either the specified ADDRESS, or
        randomly create one
-h, --help
        Show help
-r, --recent
        View the most recent email message
-t, --text
        View the email as raw text, where all the HTML tags are removed.
        Without this option, HTML is used.
